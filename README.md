# SQL Injection Testing Tool

## Overview

This Python tool is designed for testing SQL Injection vulnerabilities in web forms. It utilizes the `requests` library for HTTP requests and `BeautifulSoup` for HTML parsing.

## Features

- Identifies and extracts forms from a given URL.
- Tests for SQL Injection vulnerabilities in the identified forms.
- Provides feedback on potential vulnerabilities.

## Usage

1. **Installation**

   ```bash
   pip install requests
   pip install beautifulsoup4
   ```

2. **Run the Tool**

   ```bash
   python3 sql_injection_tester.py
   ```

   - Enter the target URL when prompted.

## How it Works

1. The `get_all_forms(url)` function retrieves all HTML forms from the specified URL using `requests` and `BeautifulSoup`.

2. The `test_sqli(url, data)` function tests each form for potential SQL Injection vulnerabilities by injecting payloads and checking the response.

3. The `main()` function orchestrates the entire process by taking user input for the target URL, identifying forms, and testing for SQL Injection vulnerabilities.

## Example

```python
# Run the tool
python sql_injection_tester.py

# Example Output
Enter the target URL: http://example.com
Potential SQL Injection vulnerability found!
```
